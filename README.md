# Sales Data Analysis

## Project Description
This project involves the analysis of sales data using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The data is sourced from a CSV file containing information on customer demographics, product categories, orders, and sales amounts. The analysis aims to identify key trends and insights related to customer behavior, purchasing power, and product performance.

## Project Overview
The analysis includes the following steps and features:

1. **Data Import and Initial Exploration**: 
   - Import necessary Python libraries.
   - Load the sales data from a CSV file.
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure, dimensions, and basic statistics.

2. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Drop unrelated or blank columns.
   - Check for and handle null values.
   - Change data types for accurate analysis.
   - Rename columns for clarity.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Gender Analysis**: Analyze the distribution of purchases between genders and their respective purchasing power.
   - **Age Analysis**: Examine the purchasing behavior across different age groups.
   - **State-wise Analysis**: Identify the top states in terms of order volume and sales amount.
   - **Marital Status Analysis**: Assess the impact of marital status on purchasing behavior.
   - **Occupation Analysis**: Determine which occupations contribute most to sales.
   - **Product Category Analysis**: Identify the most popular product categories and top-selling products.

## Key Findings
- Most of the buyers are females, with higher purchasing power compared to males.
- The age group 26-35 years constitutes the majority of buyers, especially females.
- Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka are the top states in terms of order volume and total sales.
- Married women have higher purchasing power.
- Buyers working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors are significant contributors to sales.
- Food, Clothing, and Electronics are the most popular product categories.

## Tech Stack
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Source**: CSV file ('Sales Data.csv')
